# BitcoinVisualization

Bitcoin Visualization app made with Node.js Backend and fully scalable with docker-compose.
p.s. you can scale only the `frontend` service, cause the backend must have a fixed port number, since ajax must know *an* endpoint to call.

TODO
====
use the another lb to make a single endpoint to calls 4 the backend.
